/**
 * A simple logging interface abstracting third-party logging frameworks.
 *
 * The logging levels used by Ktorm is defined in the enum class [LogLevel] in a certain order. While [TRACE] is
 * the least serious and [ERROR] is the most serious. The mapping of these log levels to the concepts used by the
 * underlying logging system is implementation dependent. The implementation should ensure, though, that this ordering
 * behaves are expected.
 *
 * By default, Ktorm auto detects a logging implementation from the classpath while creating [Database] instances.
 * If you want to output logs using a specific logging framework, you can choose an adapter implementation of this
 * interface and explicitly set the [Database.logger] property.
 *
 * Ktorm prints logs at different levels:
 *
 * - Generated SQLs and their execution arguments are printed at [DEBUG] level, so if you want to see the SQLs, you
 * should configure your logging framework to enable the [DEBUG] level.
 *
 * - Detailed data of every returned entity object are printed at [TRACE] level, if you want to see them, you should
 * configure your framework to enable [TRACE].
 *
 * - Besides, start-up messages are printed at [INFO] level, warnings are printed at [WARN] level, and exceptions are
 * printed at [ERROR] level. These levels should be enabled by default.
