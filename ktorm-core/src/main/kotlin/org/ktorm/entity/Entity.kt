/**
 * The super interface of all entity classes in Ktorm. This interface injects many useful functions into entities.
 *
 * Ktorm requires us to define entity classes as interfaces extending from this interface. A simple example is
 * given as follows:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * interface Department : Entity<Department> {
 *     val id: Int
 *     var name: String
 *     var location: String
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Creating Entity Objects
 *
 * As everyone knows, interfaces cannot be instantiated, so Ktorm provides a [Entity.create] function for us to
 * create entity objects. This function will generate implementations for entity interfaces via JDK dynamic proxy
 * and create their instances.
 *
 * In case you don't like creating objects by [Entity.create], Ktorm also provides an abstract factory class
 * [Entity.Factory]. This class overloads the `invoke` operator of Kotlin, so we just need to add a companion
 * object to our entity class extending from [Entity.Factory], then entity objects can be created just like there
 * is a constructor: `val department = Department()`.
 *
 * ### Getting and Setting Properties
 *
 * Entity objects in Ktorm are proxies, that's why Ktorm can intercept all the invocations on entities and listen
 * the status changes of them. Behind those entity objects, there is a value table that holds all the values of the
 * properties for each entity. Any operation of getting or setting a property is actually operating the underlying
 * value table. However, what if the value doesn't exist while we are getting a property? Ktorm defines a set of
 * rules for this situation:
 *
 * - If the value doesn't exist and the property’s type is nullable (e.g. `var name: String?`), then we’ll return null.
 * - If the value doesn't exist and the property’s type is not nullable (e.g. `var name: String`), then we can not
 * return null anymore, because the null value here can cause an unexpected null pointer exception, we’ll return the
 * type’s default value instead.
 *
 * The default values of different types are well-defined:
 *
 * - For [Boolean] type, the default value is `false`.
 * - For [Char] type, the default value is `\u0000`.
 * - For number types (such as [Int], [Long], [Double], etc), the default value is zero.
 * - For [String] type, the default value is an empty string.
 * - For entity types, the default value is a new-created entity object which is empty.
 * - For enum types, the default value is the first value of the enum, whose ordinal is 0.
 * - For array types, the default value is a new-created empty array.
 * - For collection types (such as [Set], [List], [Map], etc), the default value is a new created mutable collection
 * of the concrete type.
 * - For any other types, the default value is an instance created by its no-args constructor. If the constructor
 * doesn't exist, an exception is thrown.
 *
 * Moreover, there is a cache mechanism for default values, that ensures a property always returns the same default
 * value instance even if it’s called twice or more. This can avoid some counterintuitive bugs.
 *
 * ### Non-abstract members
 *
 * If we are using domain driven design, then entities are not only data containers that hold property values, there
 * are also some behaviors, so we need to add some business functions to our entities. Fortunately, Kotlin allows us
 * to define non-abstract functions in interfaces, that’s why we don’t lose anything even if Ktorm’s entity classes
 * are all interfaces. Here is an example:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * interface Foo : Entity<Foo> {
 *     companion object : Entity.Factory<Foo>()
 *     val name: String
 *     fun printName() {
 *         println(name)
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Then if we call `Foo().printName()`, the value of the property `name` will be printed.
 *
 * Besides of non-abstract functions, Kotlin also allows us to define properties with custom getters or setters in
 * interfaces. For example, in the following code, if we call `Foo().upperName`, then the value of the `name` property
 * will be returned in upper case:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * interface Foo : Entity<Foo> {
 *     companion object : Entity.Factory<Foo>()
 *     val name: String
 *     val upperName get() = name.toUpperCase()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * More details can be found in our website: https://www.ktorm.org/en/entities-and-column-binding.html#More-About-Entities
 *
 * ### Serialization
 *
 * The [Entity] interface extends from [Serializable], so all entity objects are serializable by default. We can save
 * them to our disks, or transfer them between systems through networks.
 *
 * Note that Ktorm only saves entities’ property values when serialization, any other data that used to track entity
 * status are lost (marked as transient). So we can not obtain an entity object from one system, then flush its changes
 * into the database in another system.
 *
 * Java uses [ObjectOutputStream] to serialize objects, and uses [ObjectInputStream] to deserialize them, you can
 * refer to their documentation for more details.
 *
 * Besides of JDK serialization, the ktorm-jackson module also supports serializing entities in JSON format. This
 * module provides an extension for Jackson, the famous JSON framework in Java word. It supports serializing entity
 * objects into JSON format and parsing JSONs as entity objects. More details can be found in its documentation.
