 * [TransactionManager] implementation based on JDBC.
 *
 * This class is capable of working in any environment with any JDBC driver. It accepts a [connector]
 * function used to obtain SQL connections. Applications should return a native JDBC connection in
 * the callback function, no matter it's newly established by [DriverManager] directly, or obtained
 * from a connection pool such as [DataSource].
 *
 * [Database] instances created by [Database.connect] functions use this implementation by default.

 * @property connector the callback function used to obtain SQL connections.
